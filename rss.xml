Or: why every Rust crate feels like a research paper on abstraction.</description><guid>https://daymare.net/blogs/everbody-so-creative</guid><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2025 08:39:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Godot Ruined My Sense of Speed</title><link>https://daymare.net/blogs/godot-ruined-me</link><description>Godot didn’t just ruin my game. It ruined how I think about performance and abstraction.

Four years later, I finally built one that works. And it was one hell of a journey.</description><guid>https://daymare.net/blogs/four-years-five-failures-one-compiler</guid><pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2025 14:36:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>hello world</title><link>https://daymare.net/blogs/first-blog</link><description>uh, hi, idk what to say here but helloooo. i made a static site generator for this. it takes the first line of the markdown as the title and the 2nd line as the summary actually i lied you can use multiple lines if you end the line with a \\</description><guid>https://daymare.net/blogs/first-blog</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 19:36:48 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
